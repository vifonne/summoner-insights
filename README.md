**"403 Forbidden"**
- Check your API key is valid and not expired
- Ensure you're using the correct region/tagline

**"No such table: matches"**
- Run `python3 summoner_insights.py` to initialize the database

**MCP Server not connecting**
- Verify the file paths in your Claude Desktop config
- Check that Python dependencies are installed
- Restart Claude Desktop after config changes

### Getting Help

1. Check that your `.env` file is properly configured
2. Verify your Riot API key is active
3. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
